# MuseGAN_Music_Generation
Automatic Music Generation using Multi-track Sequential Generative Adversarial Networks.

## Introduction
- This project aims at generating polyphonic(i.e. Multitrack) music using **Generative Adversarial Networks**.
- Music has a hierarchical structure, with higher-level building blocks(i.e. a phrase) made up of smaller recurrent patterns(i.e. bars/ pixels). We will be using bars as the basic unit.
